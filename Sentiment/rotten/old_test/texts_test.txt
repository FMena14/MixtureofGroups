It 's a road-trip drama with too many wrong turns .
does n't understand that the idea of exploiting molestation for laughs is funny , not actually exploiting it yourself .
lends itself beautifully to filming the teeming life on the reefs , making this gorgeous film a must for everyone from junior scientists to grown-up fish lovers
forced drama in this wildly uneven movie ,
is messy , murky , unsatisfying
When cowering and begging at the feet a scruffy Giannini , Madonna gives her best performance since Abel Ferrara had her beaten to a pulp in his Dangerous Game .

great fun , full of the kind of energy it 's documenting
Whatever heartwarming scene the impressively discreet filmmakers may have expected to record with their mini DV , they show a remarkable ability to document both sides of this emotional car-wreck .

An annoying orgy
The most surprising thing about this film is that they are actually releasing it into theaters .
a picture-perfect beach
the choppy editing to the annoying score to ` special effects ' by way of replacing objects in a character 's hands below the camera line

A burst of color , music , and dance that only the most practiced curmudgeon could fail to crack a smile at .
